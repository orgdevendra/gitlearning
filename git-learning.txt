git command:-
mkdir IaC
cd IaC
echo "first file" > file1.txt
eho "seond file" > file2.txt

Now initialize your local git repository
# git init
list the modified files which are not yet committted
# git status
before you commit move these modified files into Staging Area
# git add .
commit modified files which is there in staging area, to local git repository
# git commit -m "initial commit" (-m is passing the message)
now check the commit reference No , and too see the HEAD position , The head position will indicate the current committed file version
# git log

How to revert back to previous version , for that note down the commit ID and pass the command
# git chekout a50180 
To allow other developer to work on this code (which is locally commited) , we should push these code to
git central repository (GitHub).
